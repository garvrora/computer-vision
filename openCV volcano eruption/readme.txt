This program represents how the loudest sound wave ever produced moved across the Earth, with realistic speed and time taken to reach various places. 
This has been done using a global Earth model for representation purposes. For more accuracy, it can also be replicated on a 2D map of Earth. 
The program displays the exact speed and rate with which the wave travelled around the Earth.
It also shows the time elapsed after eruption based on its speed and the distance the blast wave covers with the help of a built-in timer and the Python time library.
The center of the circle, i.e., the point of explosion, and many other elements like lines, arrow marks, and text were put in their locations by adjusting their coordinates using trackbars.
The time library has a sleep function that delays the execution of the lines of the program after the line in which this function is called. The sleep function has been used to make each while loop iteration precisely one second long.
The distance has been calculated and represented on the map by converting kilometers to pixels and vice versa.
